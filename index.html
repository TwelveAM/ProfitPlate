            ProfitPlate is a simple tool for small restaurants to calculate
            <strong>real cost per dish, portion and profit margin</strong> —

            Add ingredients once, use them in any recipe.
            ProfitPlate calculates <strong>cost per portion automatically</strong>
            using your latest supplier prices.

              <h3>Live price updates</h3>
              <p>
                Update supplier prices once and see every affected dish update
                instantly. Perfect when butter, pancetta, salmon or fries jump in
                price overnight.

                Designed by a working chef, not an accountant. Simple enough to
                use during service, powerful enough for menu planning days.

          <p>A quick rhythm that matches how you actually work.</p>

          <ol class="steps-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Update your Purchases.</strong>
              Add or edit items from your latest invoices – butter, pancetta,
              fries, flour. Set category, sub-type, unit and price
              (or use the pack helper if the invoice is weird).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Build your Recipes.</strong>
              Pick ingredients from Purchases, set the quantities and units you
              actually use in the dish. ProfitPlate calculates batch cost and cost
              per portion automatically.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Check margin &amp; export.</strong>
              Adjust selling price until the margin looks healthy. When you’re
              happy, export a clean PDF or keep it in ProfitPlate for later.
            </li>

        <section class="home-section">
          <h2 class="section-title">Where the app is today</h2>
          <p class="text-muted">
            ProfitPlate is in early development. This version runs entirely in your
            browser using local storage — no login, no cloud, just your device.
          </p>
          <p class="text-muted">
            For now you can test <strong>Purchases</strong>,
            <strong> Recipes</strong> and <strong>Settings</strong> locally in your
            browser. In a future release, the costing app, online accounts and
            syncing will come next.
