              <p>
                In the morning, you add or update items in <strong>Purchases</strong>:
                butter, pancetta, salmon, fries, flour. Set category, sub-type,
                unit and price (or use the pack helper if the invoice is weird).

              <div class="how-step-label">2. Build your Recipes</div>
              <p>
                In <strong>Recipes</strong>, you pick ingredients from your Purchases
                list, set quantities and units actually used in the dish, and
                ProfitPlate calculates cost per portion and batch.
              </p>

              <p>
                Adjust selling price until the margin looks healthy. When you’re happy,
                export a clean PDF or just keep it in ProfitPlate for later.

            ProfitPlate is in early development. This version runs entirely in your
            browser using local storage — no login, no cloud, just your device.
            In the future this will sync to an online account so you can share
            data between phone, tablet and office PC.
          </p>

      <div class="bottom-strip">
        This is a static prototype of the ProfitPlate website. The costing app
        is coming next — for now, you can test Purchases, Recipes and Settings locally.
